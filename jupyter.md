# Jupyter Notebook Guide

## Starting a Notebook

1. Log into one of the two JupyterHub nodes and spawn a server.
       * [Artemis](http://10.12.97.79:30001/hub/login) or [Apollo](http://10.12.97.79:30001/hub/login)
       * **You may refer to the [user guide](bit.ly/sutddevbox) if you face issues.**
2. You will be presented with the file browser UI, from which you can upload, download, create and open files. 

## File Browser

This is the UI which you use to browse your Notebook's filesystem and interact with the files.

## Notebook UI

You can create a new Jupyter Notebook with a **Python 3 kernel** by selecting 'New' > 'Python 3'. You will then be presented with the Notebook UI. 

You can run `!nvidia-smi` to check if GPUs are accesible from the notebook.
